# parser requirements
requirements = """1. Input Handling: The code deals with a pointer to a buffer of bytes or a file descriptor for reading unstructured data.
2. Internal State: The code maintains an internal state in memory to represent the parsing state that is not returned as output.
3. Decision-Making: The code takes decisions based on the input and the internal state.
4. Data Structure Creation: The code builds a data structure representing the accepted input or executes specific actions on it.
5. Outcome: The code returns either a boolean value or a data structure built from the parsed data indicating the outcome of the recognition.
6. Composition: The code behavior is defined as a composition of other parsers. (Note: This requirement is only necessary if one of the previous requirements are not met. If ALL the previous 5 requirements are satisfied, this requirement becomes optional.)"""
